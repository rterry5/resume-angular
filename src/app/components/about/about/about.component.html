          <h2>A little bit about me</h2>
          <p>Originally from Florida, I moved to Oregon in 2018 and began pursuing web development more
            passionately while working from home as an IT solutions analyst. I graduated with a Bachelors in
            Anthropology from the University of Central Florida and use my spare time learning JavaScript, Angular and
            other web technologies. Cooking, playing video games, traveling, and spending time with my girlfriend, dog,
            and three cats are some of my other favorite pastimes.</p>
